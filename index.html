<P> 
<H2> Hello, my name is David Bao. I am Professor  
     in the Department of Mathematics. 
     My research work primarily concerns 
     <EM>Finsler Geometry</EM>.  Loosely speaking, 
     this is differential geometry done on Banach manifolds 
     instead of Hilbert manifolds. 
</H2>
<H4>  The person who initiated me into such an area of differential 
      geometry was the late Professor S.S. Chern 
      <A HREF="chern.jpg">jpg</A>; 
      click here 
      <A HREF="02.jpg">jpg</A> 
      for a photograph taken with him at the 2004 
      International Symposium on Finsler Geometry, 
      held in the Nankai Institute of Mathematics, Tianjin, China.  
</H4>   

<H3> I became interested in mathematics at the University of Notre Dame, 
     got my Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley, 
     and then apprenticed at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  
     (More in <A HREF="DB-SFSU-vita-Nov2021.pdf">CV</A>.)  
     After <EM>all</EM> that studying, I thought it was high time 
     to have some fun and to enjoy the good life. So in 1985 I headed straight 
     for Houston, Texas!   In 2007, I decided to get a taste of what it is 
     like to be an adminstrator at San Francisco State University. As of 2018 
	 Spring, I have returned to my regular job in research and teaching. 
</H3> 

<!--
<H4> At the University of Houston, I teach calculus, calculus, 
     and more calculus. I am slowly but surely beginning to understand 
     that subject.  This semester, I am teaching 
     Math 1450 (Accelerated Calculus) as well as 
     Math 3338 (Probability).   
</H4>

<!--
<H4> If you are interested in some material for Math 3363, a course 
     (about PDEs) that I last taught in Spring 2005,  
     please have a look at  
     <A HREF="http://math.uh.edu/~bao/Math3363notes.pdf">
                                      Math3363notes.pdf</A>.  
     There are also 18 companion Maple worksheets 
     <A HREF="http://math.uh.edu/~bao/pde2005">
                                      PDE-Mapleworksheets</A>; 
     but please make sure you have Maple9 or Maple10 installed BEFORE 
     you attempt to download these files.    
     If your interest is an eventual career in the 
     financial (actuarial, investment, ...) sector, please examine

                                      MathFinance.pdf</A>; 
     this program is currently making its way up the administrative 
     ladder of approval.

<P> 
<H3> There is a book <EM>An Introduction to Riemann-Finsler Geometry</EM> 
     <A HREF="BCSbookcover.pdf">BCSbookcover.pdf</A>
     that I co-authored with Prof. Chern (Berkeley and Nankai) 
     and Prof. Shen (IUPUI).  
     (See a photo 
     <A HREF="zBCS.jpg">jpg</A>
     of the authors, taken by the late Mrs. Chern.) 
     It is volume 200 (published in 2000) of the Springer-Verlag GTM Series. 
     Please inform me of mistakes that you find. 
     Errors and corrections will be posted as soon as they are 
     brought to my attention. Please click on 
     <A HREF="BCS-errata.pdf">BCS-Errata</A>
     to download the appropriate file for the Errata.   
</H3> 

<P>
<H3> In 2004, I co-edited a book entitled 
     <EM>A Sampler of Riemann-Finsler Geometry</EM>
     <A HREF="BBCSbookcover.pdf">
     BBCSbookcover.pdf</A>,  
     with Professors Bryant, Chern, and Shen.  
     It is volume 50 of the Cambridge University Press MSRI
     Series.  In this volume there is an expository article 
     about the curvature of Finsler manifolds, 
     with special emphasis on Einstein metrics, 
     written jointly by myself and Dr. Colleen Robles.  
     See <A HREF="zBBR.jpg">jpg</A> 
     for a photograph (with Dr. Robles and Prof. Bourguignon) 
     taken during the 2002 Workshop on Finsler Geometry, held at 
     the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley,
     California.

<p>
<H3> Other research publications and preprints are listed in my vita   
     <A HREF="http://math.uh.edu/~bao/CV">CV</A>.  
     If there is an article you would like to have, please email me. 
     Two recent works are the following.  
     The first is a short conference proceedings 
     <A HREF="http://math.uh.edu/~bao/Unicornsummary.pdf">Unicorn.pdf</A> 
     in which I pursue a perturbative approach to the search for
     unicorns in Finsler geometry.  
     The second is a long expository paper
     <A HREF="http://math.uh.edu/~bao/Curvatures_13Mar07.pdf">
     Curvatures_13Mar07.pdf</A>   
     in which I discuss two main problems based on the two curvatures 
     of Finsler metrics.  In the latter, I also propose a notion of 
     Ricci flow for Finsler metrics.

<H4> Here are some non-academic sides of me.  
     I am quite fond of certain musical instruments. 
     Do look in your attic. If you spot some junky-looking old fiddle

<P> 
<H2> In case Finsler geometry is not your cup of tea, perhaps

     would suit your fancy ?  
     Has anyone ever seen a 5-striped one ?
